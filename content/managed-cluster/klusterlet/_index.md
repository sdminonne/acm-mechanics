```math
klusterlet : ACM = kubelet : kubernetes`
```


`klusterlet` as the name suggests, is to `ACM` as `kubelet` is to `kubernetes`, more prosaically, is the `ACM` _agent_ on the managed cluster but while the `kubelet` is a single process the `klusterlet` is a set of components that interact together


Which components are needed? 

How they interact together?

How these components interact with the `Hub`?
